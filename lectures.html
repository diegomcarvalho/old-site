			<p>
				Diego Carvalho is a tenured professor at the Department of Production Engineering (DEPRO) of the Federal
				Centre for Technological Education of Rio de Janeiro (CEFET/RJ). He got his undergraduate degree in
				Production Engineering (POLI of UFRJ), and he holds a Doctor's Degree in Systems Engineering and
				Computer Science (PESC/COPPE). Besides, he is the head of the Graduate Programme of Production and
				Systems
				Engineering of CEFET/RJ.
			</p>

			<p>
				He worked at the DELPHI Experiment (CERN) as a computer scientist expert in the Complex Distributed
				Real-Time Data Acquisition & Control Systems and acted as a project manager in several object-oriented
				software development projects sponsored by the National Council for Scientific and Technological
				Development (CNPq/Brazil).
			</p>

			<p>
				He was amongst the leading researchers of grid computing projects from 2005 to 2011, when he
				participated in
				several e-Science projects funded by the European Commission, including EELA, EELA-2, and GISELA. Those
				e-Science
				projects provided computing resources to researchers from Europe and Latin America with the support of
				the
				European Grid Infrastructure (EGI). He also contributed to porting applications to the grid
				infrastructure and
				developed the Industry@Grid application, an industrial grid computing application that eases the product
				mix
				problem with stochastic optimization.
			</p>

			<p>
				In his home institution, he worked in several administrative positions. He was the head of the
				Department of Production Engineering (DEPRO) and coordinated the undergraduate course in Production
				Engineering, and he has been the pro-rector of budget and management in CEFET-RJ for three years.
			</p>

			<p>
				His professional experience covers diverse areas such as object-oriented design, distributed systems,
				network engineering, parallel architectures, grid technologies, data mining, and big data. He is a
				Senior Member of IEEE and a member of the Internet Society.
			</p>

			<p>
				I provided professional information on other sites. In Brasil, every researcher needs to keep up to date
				a résumé on an official website to access any formal grant. This website is called Plataforma Lattes,
				and you can access my cv on the following <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/3413821323159487">link</a>.
