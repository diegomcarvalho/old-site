			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

			<p>
				During the last years, my students commonly ask me about several technics turning into the
				mainstream in our daily engineering work. Among these technics, buzzy words like data mining,
				artificial intelligence, data analysis, statistics, data visualization, big data, etc., are
				overused in the media and advertisements.
			</p>

			<p>
				Typically, there are some knowledge gaps my students need to fill before actively engaging in
				the use of these technics. So, I decided to prepare a set of tips to enter this world where
				data empowers our decision ability.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, if you are ready to join this fantastic world, I divided my tips into groups where each
				level represents one higher stage in the student's formation path. Please, don't forget that
				each previous level is fundamental to achieving the next.

				He worked at the DELPHI Experiment (CERN) as a computer scientist expert in the Complex Distributed
				Real-Time Data Acquisition & Control Systems and acted as a project manager in several object-oriented
				software development projects sponsored by the National Council for Scientific and Technological
				Development (CNPq/Brazil).
			</p>

			<h2 id="ic">Tips for undergraduate research students</h2>

			<p>
				He was amongst the leading researchers of grid computing projects from 2005 to 2011, when he
				participated in
				several e-Science projects funded by the European Commission, including EELA, EELA-2, and GISELA. Those
				e-Science
				projects provided computing resources to researchers from Europe and Latin America with the support of
				the
				European Grid Infrastructure (EGI). He also contributed to porting applications to the grid
				infrastructure and
				developed the Industry@Grid application, an industrial grid computing application that eases the product
				mix
				problem with stochastic optimization.

			<h2 id="ic">Tips for master and doctoral research candidates</h2>

			<p>
				In his home institution, he worked in several administrative positions. He was the head of the
				Department of Production Engineering (DEPRO) and coordinated the undergraduate course in Production
				Engineering, and he has been the pro-rector of budget and management in CEFET-RJ for three years.
