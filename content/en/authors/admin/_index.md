Diego Carvalho is a tenured professor at the Department of Production Engineering (DEPRO) of the Federal Centre for Technological Education of Rio de Janeiro (CEFET/RJ). He got his undergraduate degree in Production Engineering (POLI of UFRJ), and he holds a Doctor's Degree in Systems Engineering and Computer Science (PESC/COPPE).

He worked at the DELPHI Experiment (CERN) as a computer scientist expert in the Complex Distributed Real-Time Data Acquisition & Control Systems. He acted as a project manager in several object-oriented software development projects sponsored by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq/Brazil).

He was amongst the leading researchers of grid computing projects from 2005 to 2011, when he participated in several e-Science projects funded by the European Commission, including EELA, EELA-2, and GISELA. Those e-Science projects provided computing resources to researchers from Europe and Latin America with the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) support. He also contributed to porting applications to the grid infrastructure. He developed the Industry@Grid application, an industrial grid computing application that eases the product mix problem with stochastic optimization.

In his home institution, he worked in several administrative positions. He was the head of the Department of Production Engineering (DEPRO) and coordinated the undergraduate course in Production Engineering (face-to-face and distance learning courses). He was the head of the Graduate Programme of Production and Systems Engineering of CEFET/RJ when the first doctoral students got admitted into the programme. He ran the center as the pro-rector of budget and management in CEFET-RJ for three years.

His professional experience covers diverse areas such as object-oriented design, distributed systems, network engineering, parallel architectures, grid technologies, data mining, and big data. He is a Senior Member of IEEE and a member of the Internet Society.
